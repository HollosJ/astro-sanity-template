# Astro Sanity Template

This is a super simple Astro Sanity template. It's a starter template for Astro Sanity projects.

**Astro v5.2** | **Tailwind v4** | **Sanity v3.79**

## Installation

The project uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces) to manage the two subrepositories. At the root level, running the following command will install the dependencies for both subrepositories: `astro-app` and `sanity`.

```
npm install
```

## Sanity Setup

Assuming you have created a Sanity account, and a new project, you will need to add your project ID and dataset name to the following files:

- `sanity/sanity.config.js`
- `sanity/sanity.cli.js`
- `astro-app/sanity.js`
- `astro-app/astro.config.mjs`

**Note:** You can do a search and replace by replacing `<project-id>` with your project ID.
